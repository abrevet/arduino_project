#Arduino Project#

This project has been initiated in my school career during.

The aim is to create a intrustion alert system:

    A user is having a device (arduino with lora) that an be enabled when an intrusion is detected with the possibility to describe the intruders based on a predefined list.
    Once the alert is launched, the security center (antother arduino) receives the alert, the user choose whether to call cops or not. If yes, an OTP code is sent to him to authenticate the alert.

    All flows are encrypted

    It will use Lora to communicate bewteen the user and the security center, GSM to call cops.
